    "Ans 1)  *       - Mathematical Operator\n",
    "        'hello' - string\n",
    "        -87.8   - integer(float)\n",
    "        -       - Mathematical Operator\n",
    "         /      - Mathematical Operator\n",
    "         +      - Mathematical Operator\n",
    "         6      - integer\n",
    " \n",
    "Ans 2)  Variable is used to assign any information temporary , data or value, While string is a type of data which can be assign under any varibale specified with inverted comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex- X=\" Hello World\"\n",
    "\n",
    "x is the varibale\n",
    "\"Hello World\" is string data type assign under X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 3) Broadly Three Different Data types are- \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Number(integer, Float, Complex no.) \n",
    "2) Sequence (String, List, Tuple)\n",
    "3) Mapping (Dictionary)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "a) integer - It represents the whole no. without any fractional part. it can be positive or negative, irrespective to  size.\n",
    "Ex - -84, 88, 5\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Float - It represents the number with fractional part,it can be positive or negative, irrespective to  size.\n",
    "Ex - -84.0, 885.215\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Complex No. - It is pair of real and imgainary no, Imaginary part is denoted with \"j\".\n",
    "EX - 2+5j\n",
    "\n",
    "d) String - String is sequence of charater that can be letters, numbers, special symbole or combination of above all enclosed within inverted comma.\n",
    " Ex - 'hello', \"shashank454\", \"4684\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans 4) It is Combination of values and  operators. it generates a single value which by itself is an expression.\n",
    " \n",
    " EX - 5+2*4 =13\n",
    " \n",
    " 5+2*4 is expression, in which 5,2 and 4 are values and \"+\" and \"*\" are operators and 13 is result of expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 5) Expression is set of values and operators, It always evaluate to value while Statement is logical action or instruction which is executed while running a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of statement is Empty, simple and compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 6) 23, Integer type data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 7)  a) 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "        b) 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 8) Variable name should not\n",
    "       a) start with any number, \n",
    "       b) cantain any space, \n",
    "       c) contain nay special symbol,\n",
    "       d) contain any keyword.\n",
    "       \n",
    "Ans 9) int(), float(), str().\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 10) This expression cause an error because in python we cant concatenate string and integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can fix it by changing the integer into string.\n",
    "'I have eaten' + '99' + 'burritos.'\n",
